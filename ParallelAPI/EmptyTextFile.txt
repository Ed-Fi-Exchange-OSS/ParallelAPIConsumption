Multithreading is a programming technique that allows a computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit) to execute multiple threads of a program concurrently. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, and multithreading enables a program to perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, taking advantage of the available CPU cores.

meaning they can execute simultaneously on multiple CPU cores (if available). This parallelism can significantly improve the program's performance, as tasks can be completed concurrently rather than sequentially.

When consuming a REST API with multithreading, there are several considerations you should keep in mind to ensure that your application performs efficiently and reliably. Multithreading can be a powerful tool for improving the performance of API requests, but it also introduces complexities and potential issues that need to be addressed. Here are some key considerations:
